## Profile üåç

I'm a python software engineer with experience in data science, data engineering and platform architecture
mainly in the water and energy industry.
I like building things related to data and hate doing things manually!
But I also like doing things the right way, using best practices and the right tool for the job.

I am passionate about the environment and other societal issues, and I'm motivated to use my skills in the most 
valuable way to contribute towards these causes.

I am also an active contributor to the [CADA network](https://autonomy.work/cada/).

## Hobbies ü•Ö

### Hobby programming

I enjoy doing some hobby programming, too, and I love the open-source philosophy. 
As well as my contribution to the dagster open-source ecosystem, I have a couple of other projects on pypi.
My main project at the moment is [ipydata](), an intuitive tool to load / operate on datasets within databases or blob
storage within notebooks or ipython sessions.

I have dabbled in Rust and JavaScript and would welcome any opportunities to work with some non-python technologies / frameworks. 

When I've had a bit more time, I've also created a [smart mirror](https://github.com/jrstats/pymirror) in python, set up email notifications whenever [@BrentfordFC](https://twitter.com/BrentfordFC/) (COYB!) [tweet about tickets going on sale](https://github.com/jrstats/twitterNotifications), and [optimised the Formula 1 calendar](https://github.com/jrstats/f1calendar/blob/master/solution.ipynb) to reduce its emissions. 
Again, feel free to take a look at them on my [github](https://github.com/jrstats) page.

I'm also a fan of the Linux desktop, currently sporting the latest EndeavourOS release. 

### Floorball

At university I picked up a strange sounding sport when I decided that ¬£600+ for a set of ice hockey gear was too much for a first year student.
Cast your mind back to the plastic hockey sticks and balls that you played with in junior school and imagine that someone made this into a real sport - [dramatic video explanation for anyone who's interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erB_FWi9-T8).
It's not that popular in the UK (and let's face it, the name doesn't help), but has a great following in north and central Europe.
The plus-side of playing a sport that no-one in your country has heard of, is that the pool of players for the national team is very small.
So as a result, I've been lucky enough to represent Great Britain in 14 matches, scoring 4 goals in this time, but I think my team GB days are behind me now.
