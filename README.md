## Profile üåç

I'm a data engineer with experience in data science and platform architecture across the water and energy industries.
I like building things related to data and hate doing things manually!
I also like doing things the right way, using best practices and the right tool for the job.

I am passionate about the environment.
The fight against climate change is the problem of our generation and I'm motivated to use my skills in the most valuable way to combat it.

I am also an active contributor to the [CADA network](https://autonomy.work/cada/).

## Hobbies ü•Ö

#### Floorball

At uni I picked up a strange sounding sport when I decided that ¬£600+ for a set of ice hockey gear was too much for a first year student.
Cast your mind back to the plastic hockey sticks and balls that you played with in junior school and imagine that someone made this into a real sport - [dramatic video explanation for anyone who's interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erB_FWi9-T8).
It's not that popular in the UK (and let's face it, the name doesn't help), but has a great following in north and central Europe.
The plus-side of playing a sport that no-one in your country has heard of, is that the pool of players for the national team is very small.
So as a result, I've been lucky enough to represent Great Britain in 14 matches, scoring 4 goals in this time, but I think my team GB days are behind me now.



#### Nerdy stuff
I enjoy doing some hobby programming, too. I'm currently teaching myself Rust (really interested by learning some more in-depth software engineering practices and a lower-level language with some brilliant and unique features) and JavaScript (not sure I need to justify this one...). 
When I've had a bit more time, I've also created a [smart mirror](https://github.com/jrstats/pymirror) in python, set up email notifications whenever [@BrentfordFC](https://twitter.com/BrentfordFC/) (COYB!) [tweet about tickets going on sale](https://github.com/jrstats/twitterNotifications), and [optimised the Formula 1 calendar](https://github.com/jrstats/f1calendar/blob/master/solution.ipynb) to reduce its emissions. 
Again, feel free to take a look at them on my [github](https://github.com/jrstats) page.

I'm also a fan of the Linux desktop, currently sporting the latest Pop_OS! release. I love the open-source philosophy, have contributed to the dagster open-source project, and I'm keen to contribute to more open-source projects in the future.
